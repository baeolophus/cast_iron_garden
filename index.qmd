Several big problems can be addressed with native plants

1. The biodiversity crisis in general
    a. The insect apocalypse in particular
    b.  Invasive species harming local ecosystems
2. Water shortages
3. Carbon footprints

Actually, it can! Every plant can make a difference in ever-expanding human colonization of the landscape [@vogtRewildingSuburbiaAmerican2023].  Many insects are tiny, and thus even tiny changes can help them [@TinyPlacesTiny].

Water usage by lawns.

Carbon footprint of shipping non-native plants or cut flowers, foods.


#### I live in an apartment, I don't think so.

### Saving you money

:::

- Water shortages
- Endless annuals from big box stores
- Fewer plants that fail dramatically
- Tax dollars spent keeping invasive species out of special places like public lands
- Tax subsidies spent keeping invasive species out of food/agricultural lands

### Saving you time
This overlaps a lot with saving you money.  But also, once things are established in appropriate habitats, goodbye endless watering!  

This does not count if you become an obsessive gardener.
