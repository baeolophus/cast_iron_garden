# The really really short version {#sec-short}

## Stop stuff

### Stop killing things

Stop killing insects and plants. If you have plants breaking your driveway cracks, pour boiling water on it. We'll get to roundup/bermudagrass/poison ivy in a bit, but for now, just stop until you know what you are doing.

### Stop doing so much unnecessary work

Leave the leaves. Leave the twigs. Leave stuff where it falls unless it's a tripping hazard.

### Stop watering stuff that's not in pots

Save time, save money, save water.

## Start stuff

### Add in new things between October and April. (NOT IN THE SUMMER)

Plants are easy if you put them in the right spot, and it's okay if some die. This book covers a very small area, so I can tell you almost exactly what's going to work at some place in your yard. But, it's still okay if some plants die. That's how gardening works. We do our best and keep going.

### Pick plants that are tough

Just because a plant is native doesn't mean it's native to your yard. However, there are a few species that work all over town, usually.

first determine where you are and what kind of soil you have. Soil types in Norman area and pictures of them wet and dry and crumbliness

Almost anywhere in Norman that's sunny and not touching standing water: - Maximilian sunflower\index{sunflower!Maximilian}

Shady\index{shade}: - White avens - Lyre Leaf sage - Inland Sea Oats

If you have the red soil\index{soil!red clay}and live on the "north" (loosely north) side of town, these are your keystone plants:

If you have the sandy soil\index{soil!sandy} and elsewhere in town, plant these:

Dark clay\index{soil!black gumbo}

For more species and what they like, see @sec-species.

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **quarto** package [@R-quarto] to format this book.  Some ideas from [@odellHowNothing2019].
