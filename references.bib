The Gardener's Guide to Prairie Plants is the one-stop compendium for all gardeners aspiring to use native prairie plants in their gardens. Neil Diboll and Hilary Cox--two renowned prairie gardeners--compile more than four decades' worth of research to offer a wide-ranging and definitive reference for starting and maintaining prairie and meadow gardens and restorations. Alongside detailed synopses of plant life cycles, meticulous range maps, and sweeping overviews of natural history, Diboll and Cox also include photographs of 148 prairie plants in every stage of development, from seedling to seedhead. North America's grasslands once stretched from the Blue Ridge to the Rocky Mountains, and from Texas to Manitoba, blanketing the mid-continent with ecologically important, garden-worthy, native species. This book provides all the inspiration and information necessary for eager native planters from across the country to welcome these plants back to their landscapes. The Gardener's Guide to Prairie Plants is a must-have reference for gardeners, restorationists, and every flora fan with a passion for native plants, prairies and meadows.},

This extensively revised and expanded second edition broadens the reach and depth of the permaculture approach for urban and suburban growers. Many people mistakenly think that ecological gardening?which involves growing a wide range of edible and other useful plants?can take place only on a large, multiacre scale. As Hemenway demonstrates, it?s fun and easy to create a?backyard ecosystem? by assembling communities of plants that can work cooperatively and perform a variety of functions, including: Building and maintaining soil fertility and structure Catching and conserving water in the landscape Providing habitat for beneficial insects, birds, and animals Growing an edible?forest? that yields seasonal fruits, nuts, and other foods This revised and updated edition also features a new chapter on urban permaculture, designed especially for people in cities and suburbs who have very limited growing space. Whatever size yard or garden you have to work with, you can apply basic permaculture principles to make it more diverse, more natural, more productive, and more beautiful. Best of all, once it?s established, an ecological garden will reduce or eliminate most of the backbreaking work that?s needed to maintain the typical lawn and garden},

  abstract = {In Europe, 50\%--70\% of former natural grassland area has been destroyed during the past 30 years due to land use changes, losses are expected to increase in the future. Restoration is thought to reverse this situation by creating suitable abiotic conditions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of sod translocation with specific vegetation to facilitate the restoration of a former intensive agricultural field into a wet meadow. First, starting conditions were optimized including modification of the local hydrology, removal of the fertilized topsoil, application of liming, and translocation of fresh clippings as a seed source. The second part aimed at restoring the habitat for the butterfly species Phengaris (Maculinea) teleius, one of the species that was especially affected by the loss of wet meadows. This species engages in a complex myrmecophilous relationship with one host plant, Sanguisorba officinalis, and one obligate host ant, Myrmica scabrinodis. We used sod translocation to create islands of habitat to promote host plant and host ant colonization. After 4 years following the restoration, we observed that plants spread from the transplanted sods to the surroundings. The vegetation composition and structure of the transplanted sods attracted colonization of Myrmica ants into the restored areas. Following the increase in vegetation cover and height, Myrmica ant colonies further spread into the restored areas. Therefore, sod translocations can be considered an effective restoration method following topsoil removal in the process of restoring wet meadows to provide a starting point for ant colonization and plant dispersion. With these findings, this paper contributes to the evidence-based restoration of wet meadows on former agricultural fields, including complex interactions between invertebrates and their required ecological relationships.},

Yet few examine why our urban wildlife gardens matter so much-not just for ourselves, but for the larger human and animal communities.Our landscapes push aside wildlife and in turn diminish our genetically programmed love for wildness. How can we get ourselves back into balance through gardens, to speak life's language and learn from other species?Benjamin Vogt addresses why we need a new garden ethic, and why we urgently need wildness in our daily lives-lives sequestered in buildings surrounded by monocultures of lawn and concrete that significantly harm our physical and mental health. He examines the psychological issues around climate change and mass extinction as a way to understand how we are short-circuiting our response to global crises, especially by not growing native plants in our gardens. Simply put, environmentalism is not political; it's social justice for all species marginalized today and for those facing extinction tomorrow. By thinking deeply and honestly about our built landscapes, we can create a compassionate activism that connects us more profoundly to nature and to one another.},

  abstract = {Asclepiadaceae are the dicot counterparts to the Orchidaceae, which also transmit their pollen grains in large groups within pollinia. Unlike many terrestrial, nectar-producing orchids, however, milkweeds are characterized by low fruit-set, typically averaging 1-5\%. Transfer of hundreds of pollen grains as a unit makes it possible to quantify pollinator activity and male and female reproductive success more directly and more easily in milkweeds than in plants with loose pollen grains. It also leads to the production of fruits whose seeds all share a single father, thus simplifying paternity analysis. Recent anatomical work has demonstrated that three of the five stigmatic chambers of milkweed flowers transmit pollen tubes to one of the two separate ovaries, whereas the other two chambers transmit only to the second ovary. Milkweed flowers are long-lived and produce copious nectar, which flows from nectaries within the stigmatic chambers to fill the hoods, which serve as reservoirs. Nectar also serves as the germination fluid for pollen grains, but concentrations above 30\% inhibit germination. Most milkweeds are genetically self-incompatible and express an unusual late-acting form of ovarian rejection. Some weedy milkweeds, however, are self-compatible, and levels of self-insertion of pollinia are apparently high in these, as well as in self-incompatible, species. Early attempts to explain the evolution of inflorescence size in milkweeds were hampered by failure to consider the genetic basis of the variation observed and by failure to determine the unit on which selection should act. Direct tests of the "pollen donation" hypothesis have cast doubt on the validity of the view that flower number and other floral traits evolved primarily to enhance male reproductive success. Milkweeds are pollinated by a diverse array of large bees, wasps, and butterflies, and these generalist pollinators effect extensive gene flow within and between populations, augmented by wind dispersal of comose seeds. Morphological and biochemical evidence support the view that limited, localized hybridization occurs between sympatric species of milkweeds.},
