    "text": "2.4 Add in new things between October and April. (NOT IN THE SUMMER)\nPlants are easy if you put them in the right spot, and it’s okay if some die. This book covers a very small area, so I can tell you almost exactly what’s going to work at some place in your yard. But, it’s still okay if some plants die. That’s how gardening works. We do our best and keep going.\nOkay, first determine where you are and what kind of soil you have. -Soil types in Norman area and pictures of them wet and dry and crumbliness\nAlmost anywhere in Morman that’s sunny and not touching standing water: - Maximilian sunflower\nShady: - White avens - Lyre Leaf sage - Inland Sea Oats\nIf you have the red soil and live on the “north” (loosely north) side of town, these are your keystone plants:\nIf you have the sandy soil and elsewhere in town, plant these:\nYou can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter @ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter @ref(methods).\nFigures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively.\n\npar(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))\nplot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)\n\n\n\n\nHere is a nice figure!\n\n\n\n\nReference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure @ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table @ref(tab:nice-tab).\n\nknitr::kable(\n  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',\n  booktabs = TRUE\n)\n\n\nHere is a nice table!\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.7\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.8\n3.4\n1.6\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.8\n3.0\n1.4\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n4.3\n3.0\n1.1\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n5.8\n4.0\n1.2\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.7\n4.4\n1.5\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.3\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.7\n3.8\n1.7\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.1\n3.8\n1.5\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write citations, too.
